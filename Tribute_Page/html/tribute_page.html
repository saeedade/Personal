        <h2>Here is Arsene Wenger's Timeline:</h2>
        <p><strong>Arsène Charles Ernest Wenger</strong> OBE (French pronunciation: ​[aʁsɛn vɛŋɡɛʁ]; born 22 October 1949) is a French football manager and former player. 
           He was the manager of Arsenal from 1996 to 2018, where he was the longest-serving and most successful in the club's history.Arsene Wenger came 
           to Arsenal having won just one Ligue 1 title, a Coupe de France, the Emperor's Cup and the J-League Super Cup.
           But less than two years into the job, he led the Gunners to the double, breaking Man United's dominance in the Premier League and
           beating Newcastle in the FA Cup final.Another double then followed in 2002 when Wenger led his side to the title at Old Trafford 
           and a Ray Parlour strike helped secure a 2-0 cup final win over Chelsea. And his most impressive achievement was leading the 2004 
           invincibles to an unbeaten Premier League season, a feat never matched since.</p>
        <p>Two years later he brought his team to the brink of Champions League glory only to lose 2-1 in the final to Barcelona.
           In total, Wenger won 17 trophies during his time with the Gunners - three Premier Leagues, seven FA Cups and seven Community Shields.
           But interestingly, he did not win anything other than those three titles.However, that can be put right if he wins the Europa League 
           at the end of this season and brings his trophy haul to 18. Arsenal got to the final of the competition in 2000, when it was called 
           the Uefa Cup, but lost on penalties to Galatasaray.

        <div><q>I am pleased that he has announced he is leaving at this stage of the season, as he can now have the send-off
           that he truly deserves.
           He is, without doubt, one of the greatest Premier League managers and I am proud to have been a rival, a
           colleague and a friend to such a great man.</q>
